# We want Kube 1.20+ so that on-demand runners can be cleaned up properly.
# This uses the Job expiration fields that was introduced in 1.20. Without
# this, thousands of dead pods will pollute the Kubernetes server.
#
# IMPORTANT: the "-0" suffix on here is necessary for EKS and GKE to validate
# since they use a modified version of Kubernetes.
